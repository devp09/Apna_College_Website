            <h3>Aman Dhattarwal</h3>
            <h4>Young TEDx speaker and #1 Online JEE Educator | Founder of 5 YouTube Channels with 2.5 million young
                hustlers.</h4>
            <p>I help students across India find their right career path. I have been a guest speaker at 22 Colleges
                including Top IITs, BITS Pilani, IIIT's, NIT's, SRCC, Jadavpur University etc. I am the #1 Educator of
                JEE on India's biggest online platform
                and I believe that everyone has the right to quality education and with the help of my social media
                platforms, I have helped millions of students find their path to success in the last 5 years. In the
                next few decades, India will rise
                as the leader of the world with the maximum young workforce, but for this, we need some good pilots who
                can take us through this. I help these young hustlers find their true potential so that they can fly us
                to victory.</p>
